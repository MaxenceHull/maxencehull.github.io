content: |
  I'm passionate about technology (but not only) and try to resolve any problem with code (but not always).

  Over the years, I spent a decent amount of time:
   * dealing with data-related problems: data pipeline, Big Data Management or plain old SQL optimization
   * conceiving microservices (mostly in Go or Java) in order to add robustness, scalability and faster deployment to legacy architectures
   * making development easier for teammates by improving CI/CD, monitoring, alerting...
   * listening and speaking to my fellow devs during Meetups to learn and share experiences
  
  After more than 9 years in Canada, I decided to move back to Europe and I'm currently looking for a job there!
  
  When I don't code, my time is shared between reading, running, skiing and playing Mario Kart.
